# Welcome to talosPy documentation

TalosPy is a template for building Shiny applications with Python. It is based on the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) library. The goal of talosPy is to provide a simple way to create Shiny applications with Python.

> **Note**: This documentation is a work in progress. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/talospy).

## Installation

To install talosPy, you need to have [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can install it by following the instructions on the [`pipx` website](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/).

Once you have `pipx` installed, you can install `cookiecutter` by running the following command:

```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```

After installing `cookiecutter`, you can use the `talospy` template by running the following command:

```bash
pipx run cookiecutter gh:ThinkR-open/talospy
```

This command will create a new directory with the name you provide. Inside this directory, you will find the files and folders needed to start building your Shiny application.
